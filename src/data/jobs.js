We are driven to support the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in making cricket the most inclusive team sport in England and Wales, and aim to achieve this by creating, developing and delivering fun, safe, inclusive cricket activity for people of all abilities, women, men, girls, boys, of all ages, in both urban and rural locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking for a passionate, community-focused individual to lead the way in making cricket more inclusive and representative of the wonderfully diverse communities across our region, with a focus on Bristol.

The volunteer will also support the head coach in creating team strategies and individual performance plans (IPPs). This will involve collaboration with selectors, captains, and other coaching staff to identify and nurture emerging talent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>By supporting the coaches, you will create professional players who are not only skillful but also nurtured in a positive and inclusive team culture that align with PCI’s values of professionalism, sportsmanship, and unity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>To be considered for this role, you must posses&nbsp;Level 1 Cricket Coaching Accreditation (Level 2 is a plus) or international equivalent. You also need to have proven experience in batting coaching at high-performance levels. Experience coaching in a multicultural or international environment will be a plus.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>﻿About the Partner Organisation</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Persatuan Cricket Indonesia’s (PCI) aim and purpose is to ensure that cricket becomes one of the better performing sports in Indonesia and to achieve a position as one of the top three popular sports in Indonesia. We are also attempting to expand the reach of Cricket to every region in Indonesia. Presently there are 18 provincial committees (out of 34 Provinces), ranging from Aceh, in the West to Papua in the East, with 3 association members; Bogor Cricket Association, Bali Cricket and Jakarta Cricket Association. Those associations are responsible for organizing competitions, introducing and socializing cricket in the society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PCI has succeeded with its programs and cricket has been growing fast in Indonesia. Many people have commenced playing cricket without regard to their age or gender. The sport is not limited to adults or expats; Men, Women and Children participate on an equal basis. PCI is continuing to develop its programs in order to be qualified to provide training, short courses and seminars for coaches, referees, and cricket supporting officials. The most important thing is becoming a national pride sport for Indonesia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About the Australian Volunteers Program&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Australian Volunteers Program is an Australian government-funded initiative.

      '\n<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cricket Scotland is the national governing body for the sport of cricket in Scotland. It is responsible for organising and developing the game at all levels, from grassroots participation to elite international competitions. The organisation’s primary goal is to promote and enhance the growth of cricket in Scotland, both in terms of player development and the overall popularity of the sport. Cricket Scotland’s new four-year strategy focuses on this goal through a desire to unite people and communities through cricket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cricket has a long history in Scotland, with records dating back to the 18th century. Scotland became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1994.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Scotland men’s and women’s national cricket teams compete in various international tournaments and both teams have achieved recent notable successes, with memorable victories against higher-ranked teams and impressive performances in global competitions. These achievements have helped raise the profile of cricket in Scotland and inspire more young players to pursue the sport. The senior teams’ successes have been backed up by the men’s and women’s U19 teams consistently reaching their respective ICC World Cups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the national teams, Cricket Scotland is actively involved in developing cricket at the grassroots level. The organisation supports and organises various leagues, tournaments, and coaching programmes throughout the country. These initiatives aim to increase participation, identify talented players, and provide them with the necessary training and resources to progress in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s happening in Cricket?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the significant high-performance success of our national teams, including Scotland’s inclusion at our first ever ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in 2024, Cricket Scotland is currently reviewing and updating our governance arrangements to ensure we build a highperforming governing body of sport for the future. To achieve this, we recently launched our 2024-2028 strategy – Uniting People and Communities through Cricket – which clarifies our vision and the actions we will take to achieve our strategic objectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our strategy sets out a definitive vision and pathway for cricket in Scotland, with a particular focus on:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Inspiring women and girls to play cricket</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Embedding a culture of equality</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Developing sustainable success on the pitch</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Cricket Scotland becoming a trusted and effective governing body</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why join us?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an exciting time for Cricket Scotland as we look to move forward as an organisation to deliver our vision for the sport. Scotland will also cohost to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2030 with England and Ireland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the role of the Domestic Cricket Committee?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Domestic Cricket Committee (DCC) is one of the standing committees of Cricket Scotland Council Limited (CSCL) Board.

      '\n<p><strong>About the role</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to be a cricket aficionado to succeed at QC, but our ideal candidate will be passionate about playing their part in the smooth operation of key HR activities in this true generalist role. Our (the People &amp; Culture team’s) goal is to help develop great teams, and ensure our people are equipped to do their best work each day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a truly varied and exciting role, with plenty of exposure to a broad range of HR functions. We’re a small but mighty team (of two), who thrive in a fast-paced, high-performing environment. QC is a fun, social workplace, but we never lose sight of our goals or professionalism. You’ll report to an experienced and supportive People &amp; Culture Manager who values innovation, creativity and finding new ways to solve old problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a part-time role, ideally around the equivalent of up to 4 days per week. We’re open to what this looks like, whether it’s flexibility around family responsibilities, study commitments, or making more time for the things that bring you joy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this role, you’ll find yourself:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>Coordinating employee lifecycle activities; this might mean running end-to-end recruitment campaigns, setting new staff for success from their first day by managing the onboarding and induction process, and administering QC’s annual performance cycles.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Acting as People &amp; Culture’s first point of contact, managing group email inboxes and responding to employee and manager queries, escalating where necessary.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Managing all aspects of HR administration, from drafting employment correspondence, contracts and variation letters, to reviewing and updating policies and procedures, and maintaining employee documentation, our HRIS (currently Cornerstone) and compliance checks (Blue Cards).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;Supporting People &amp; Culture initiatives – think coordinating employee engagement surveys and assisting with reporting and HR metrics, administering QC’s health, wellbeing and reward and recognition programs (we offer our team things like free skin checks, celebrate with quarterly awards, and enjoy lunchtime yoga). We’re also about to kick off implementation of our new HRIS, Workday – supported by the wider Cricket Australia team, the People &amp; Culture Coordinator will be crucial in the success of this project at QC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, you’ll bring a passion for doing great work and using your skills to empower people to bring their best each day. You’ll have a creative, curious approach to human resources, a commitment to continuous improvement and innovation, and a keen desire to learn and grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Queensland Cricket</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queensland Cricket is responsible for leading and administering cricket throughout Queensland. Our purpose is to promote and grow cricket ensuring all Queenslanders can play, participate, and enjoy the game. Our flagship teams include Queensland Bulls, Queensland Fire and Brisbane Heat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Queensland Cricket values diversity and is an equal opportunity employer. Your age, gender, sexual orientation, disability or religion won’t impact whether you’re part of the team; it’s your drive to do great work that’ll help you shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to join our team?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click ‘apply’ to submit your application, which includes a cover letter outlining:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class="wp-block-list">\n<li>&nbsp;Your favourite aspect of human resources</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;What excites you about joining the team at QC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;The skills, experience and qualities that make you the best candidate.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We’ll review applications as they’re received, so please apply early!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our values – We Care, We Lead, We Deliver, and We Innovate – are embedded in everything we do. We’re eager to meet people who can contribute to our team in a variety of ways, not just candidates who check all the boxes. Even if you don’t feel you meet every requirement for this role, we still encourage you to apply. Reach out to Jessica at careers@qldcricket.com.au with any questions about the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We require all applicants to undergo background check and screening prior to or during any appointments. Queensland Cricket is committed to providing a safe environment for everyone involved in our sport, including children.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Queensland Cricket acknowledges that we reside on traditional lands of the Yuggera people and the Turrbal people. We offer our respect to the Elders of these traditional lands, and through them to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples past, present, and emerging.</em></p>\n',
